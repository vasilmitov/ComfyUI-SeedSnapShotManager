## ⚙️ Usage
1. Add the **Seed Snapshot Manager** node to your workflow.
2. Connect a `seed` value into it, or let it generate one.
3. Use the **Reset Seed** button to quickly assign a new random seed.
4. Seeds are saved under labels and can be restored later.

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Multiple seed snapshots per workflow.
- Import/export snapshots to JSON.
- Sync with workflow metadata for automatic saving.
